## WHAT IS DREAMCITY?
Dream City is an audience-driven community located on campsite H, one of Roskilde Festival's most central camping areas.

Everything in Dream City is created by like-minded festival-goers, who want to elevate the festival experience by contributing with their own unique idea. It can be anything from pillow fights to funky camp monuments, as long as it’s sustainable, safe and contributes to not just your own experience but also other festival-goers.

The philosophy behind Dream City rests upon the idea of giving ownership back to the audience, by giving you the opportunity to create and build your own unique camping area before the festival starts.

With other ‘dreamers’ you will be part of Dream City - a community which thrives on making festival memories for everyone. It’s truly about co-creation, collaboration, sustainability and great ideas!
